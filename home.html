                <p class="SSD1_p">Technology has impacted the world with negative and positive environmental impacts,<br> which are usually the reverse of the initial damage, such as;<br> the creation of pollution and the attempt to undo said pollution,deforestation and the reversing of deforestation,<br>and oil spills. All of these have had a significant impact on the environment of the earth. As technology has advanced, so has the negative environmental impact,<br> with the releasing of greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect,<br> gradually heating the earth and causing global warming.<br> All of this has become worse with the advancement of technology.</p>

        <h2 class="SSD1_h2">Jobs</h2>
        <p class="SSD1_p">Since the invention of the wheel, technologies have helped increase humans' economic output. Past automation has both substituted and complemented labor; machines replaced humans at some lower-paying jobs (for example in agriculture), but this was compensated by the creation of new, higher-paying jobs.Studies have found that computers did not create significant net technological unemployment.Due to artificial intelligence being far more capable than computers, and still being in its infancy, it is not known whether it will follow the same trend; the question has been debated at length among economists and policymakers. A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment.According to the World Economic Forum's "The Future of Jobs Report 2020", AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide, and create 97 million new jobs by 2025.From 1990 to 2007, a study in the U.S by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu showed that an addition of one robot for every 1,000 workers decreased the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2%, or about 3.3 workers, and lowered wages by 0.42%.Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting. As US president Lyndon Johnson said in 1964, "Technology is creating both new opportunities and new obligations for us, opportunity for greater productivity and progress; obligation to be sure that no workingman, no family must pay an unjust price for progress." upon signing the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress bill</p>

        <h2 class="SSD1_h2">Modern</h2>
        <p class="SSD1_p">Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the discovery of steam power set off the Industrial Revolution, which saw wide-ranging technological discoveries, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, and the widespread application of the factory systemThis was followed a century later by the Second Industrial Revolution which led to rapid scientific discovery, standardization, and mass production.  New technologies were developed, including sewage systems, electricity, light bulbs, electric motors, railroads, automobiles, and airplanes.  These technological advances led to significant developments in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering.They were accompanied by consequential social change, with the introduction of skyscrapers accompanied by rapid urbanization.Communication improved with the invention of the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, and television.

            The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission in the  Atomic Age led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Computers were invented and later shifted from analog to digital in the Digital Revolution. Information technology, particularly optical fiber and optical amplifiers led to the birth of the Internet, which ushered in the Information Age. The Space Age began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, and later  the launch of crewed missions to the moon in the 1960s. Organized efforts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence have used radio telescopes todetect signs of technology use, or technosignatures, given off by alien civilizations. In medicine, new technologies were developed for diagnosis (CT, PET, and MRI scanning), treatment (like the dialysis machine, defibrillator, pacemaker, and a wide array of new pharmaceutical drugs), and research(like interferon cloning and DNA microarrays).
            
            Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies, and entire industries have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly  more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education  their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training.Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them, including engineering, medicine, and computer science; and other fields have become more complex, such as construction, transportation, and architecture.</p>
